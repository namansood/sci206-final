		<p>
			This is the kind of motion where all parts of an object move the
			same distance with respect to each other, that is,
			the entire object moves as a single entity.

		<h2>Rotational Motion</h2>
		<p>
			This is the kind of motion where an object moves about an axis 
			and different parts of it move different distances in a given time &ndash;
			the parts closer to the axis move lesser than the parts that are further away.

<section class="three-laws">
	<div class="law">
		<h2>First Law</h2>
		<blockquote>
			An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion
			stays in motion, until and unless a force is applied to it.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Until we apply a force on the balls, they remain at rest. 
			When the balls are moving, they only come to a stop when a resisting
			force is applied.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="law">
		<h2>Second Law</h2>
		<blockquote>
			The force applied on an object is directly proportional to its
			acceleration.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			If we apply &ldquo;more force&rdquo; by pushing a ball multiple
			times in the same direction, the ball is accelerated more and hence
			gains more velocity.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="law">
		<h2>Third Law</h2>
		<blockquote>
			For every action (force) in nature, there is an equal and opposite
			reaction.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			When the two balls collide, one ball applies a force on the second,
			and at the same time experiences an equal force in the opposite direction
			from the second ball.

		<h2>Mass and Weight</h2>
		<p>
			The gravitational force is the force that attracts
			any two objects with mass.
		</p> 
		<p>
			The difference between weight and mass is that mass
			remains constant for an object throughout the universe,
			whereas weight can change depending on the the gravitational
			force.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since weighing machines measure weight and not mass, a weighing
			machine designed for the Earth would give different readings on
			another celestial body, like Mars or the Moon &ndash; as you can
			see in the calculator on the right!

		Other Important Forces
	</h1>
</section>

<section class="three-laws">
	<div class="law">
		<h2>Normal Force</h2>
		<p>
			According to Newton's third law,
			surfaces in contact with an object
			exert a force on the object that is
			equal and opposite to the force the
			object is exerting on them. This is
			called the normal force.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="law">
		<h2>Tension</h2>
		<p>
			This is the force that is transmitted
			though a rope or string that has forces
			acting on it at both ends. Tension in a
			string is always equal across the length
			of the string.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="law">
		<h2>Friction</h2>
		<p>
			The frictional force is the force generated
			by two objects in contact with each other.
			This force is primarily of three types:
			static, kinetic and sliding. Static friction
			is the highest in magnitude, followed by kinetic,
			and finally sliding.
